/**
 * The frontend is concerned with the translation of text to structured information.
 * The key functionality is given by the scanner and the parser. A scanner 
 * transforms a text into a stream of tokens. A parser converts a stream of
 * token into a stream of variables and tokens that are part of a formal language.
 * A formal language is described using a set of rules that are collected in an
 * object of type RuleSet.
