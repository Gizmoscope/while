/**
 * The Hoare package provides utilities for proving the correctness of programs.
 * What a program is supposed to do is expressed by a Hoare triple consisting of
 * a precondition, a statement and a postcondition. The Class BasicHoare mimics
 * the well known Hoare calculus consiting of axioms and rules from which the
 * validity of Hoare triples can be derived.
